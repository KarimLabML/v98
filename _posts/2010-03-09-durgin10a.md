title: Hardness of Improper One-Sided Learning of Conjunctions For All Uniformly Falsifiable
  CSPs
abstract: "We consider several closely related variants of PAC-learning in which false-positive
  and false-negative errors are treated differently. In these models we seek to guarantee
  a given, low rate of false-positive errors and asfew false-negative errors as possible
  given that we meet the false-positived\tconstraint. Bshouty and Burroughs first
  observed that learning conjunctions in such models would enable PAC-learning of
  DNF in the usual distribution-free model; in turn, results of Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz
  establish that learning of DNF would imply algorithms for refuting random k-SAT
  using far fewer constraints than believed possible. Such algorithms would violate
  a slight strengthening of Feigeâ€™s R3SAT assumption, and would violate the RCSP hypothesis
  of Barak et al. We show here that actually, an algorithm for learning conjunctions
  in this model would have much more far-reaching consequences: it gives refutation
  algorithms for all predicates that are falsified by one of the uniform constant
  strings. To our knowledge, this is the first hardness result of improper learning
  for such a large class of natural average-case problems with natural distributions."
