title: Minimax Learning of Ergodic Markov Chains
abstract: We compute the finite-sample minimax (modulo logarithmic factors) sample
  complexity of learning the parameters of a finite Markov chain from a single long
  sequence of states. Our error metric is a natural variant of total variation. The
  sample complexity necessarily depends on the spectral gap and minimal stationary
  probability of the unknown chain, for which there are known finite-sample estimators
  with fully empirical confidence intervals. To our knowledge, this is the first PAC-type
  result with nearly matching (up to logarithmic factors) upper and lower bounds for
  learning, in any metric, in the context of Markov chains.
