title: Adaptive Exact Learning of Decision Trees from Membership Queries
abstract: In this paper we study the adaptive learnability of decision trees of depth
  at most $d$ from membership queries. This has many applications in automated scientific
  discovery such as drugs development and software update problem. Feldman solves
  the problem in a randomized polynomial time algorithm that asks $\tilde O(2^{2d})\log
  n$ queries and Kushilevitz-Mansour in a deterministic polynomial time algorithm
  that asks $ 2^{18d+o(d)}\log n$ queries. We improve the query complexity of both
  algorithms. We give a randomized polynomial time algorithm that asks $\tilde O(2^{2d})
  + 2^{d}\log n$ queries and a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that asks $2^{5.83d}+2^{2d+o(d)}\log
  n$ queries.
