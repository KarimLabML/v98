title: "Generalize Across Tasks: Efficient Algorithms for Linear\r Representation
  Learning"
abstract: "We present provable algorithms for learning linear representations which
  are trained in a supervised\r fashion across a number of tasks. Furthermore, whereas
  previous methods in the context of multitask learning only allow for generalization
  within tasks that have already been observed, our\r representations are both efficiently
  learnable and accompanied by generalization guarantees to\r unseen tasks. Our method
  relies on a certain convex relaxation of a non-convex problem, making\r it amenable
  to online learning procedures. We further ensure that a low-rank representation
  is\r maintained, and we allow for various trade-offs between sample complexity and
  per-iteration cost,\r depending on the choice of algorithm."
