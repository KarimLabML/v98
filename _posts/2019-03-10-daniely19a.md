title: 'Competitive ratio vs regret minimization: achieving the best of both worlds'
abstract: "We consider online algorithms under both the competitive ratio\r criteria
  and the regret minimization one. Our main goal is to build\r a unified methodology
  that would be able to guarantee both criteria\r simultaneously.\r For a general
  class of online algorithms, namely any Metrical Task\r System (MTS), we show that
  one can simultaneously guarantee the best\r known competitive ratio and a natural
  regret bound. For the paging\r problem we further show an efficient online algorithm
  (polynomial in the number of pages) with this guarantee.\r To this end, we extend
  an existing regret minimization algorithm\r (specifically, Kapralov and Panigrahy
  2011) to handle movement cost (the cost of\r switching between states of the online
  system). We then show how to\r use the extended regret minimization algorithm to
  combine multiple\r online algorithms. Our end result is an online algorithm that
  can\r combine a “base” online algorithm, having a guaranteed competitive\r ratio,
  with a range of online algorithms that guarantee a small\r regret over any interval
  of time. The combined algorithm guarantees\r both that the competitive ratio matches
  that of the base algorithm\r and a low regret over any time interval.\r As a by
  product, we obtain an expert algorithm with close to optimal\r regret bound on every
  time interval, even in the presence of\r switching costs. This result is of independent
  interest."
