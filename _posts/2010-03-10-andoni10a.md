title: Attribute-efficient learning of monomials over highly-correlated variables
abstract: We study the problem of learning a real-valued function of correlated variables.
  Solving this problem is of interest since many classical learning results apply
  only in the case of learning functions of random variables that are independent.
  We show how to recover a high-dimensional, sparse monomial model from Gaussian examples
  with sample complexity that is poly-logarithmic in the total number of variables
  and polynomial in the number of relevant variables. Our algorithm is based on a
  transformation of the variables—taking their logarithm—followed by a sparse linear
  regression procedure, which is statistically and computationally efficient.  While
  this transformation is commonly used in applied non-linear regression, its statistical
  guarantees have never been rigorously analyzed. We prove that the sparse regression
  procedure succeeds even in cases where the original features are highly correlated
  and fail to satisfy the standard assumptions required for sparse linear regression.
