title: Optimal Collusion-Free Teaching
abstract: "Formal models of learning from teachers need to respect certain criteria
  to avoid collusion. The most commonly accepted notion of collusion-freeness was
  proposed by Goldman and Mathias (1996), and various teaching models obeying their
  criterion have been studied. For each model $M$ and each concept class $\\mathcal{C}$,
  a parameter $M$-$\\mathrm{TD}(\\mathcal{C})$ refers to the \\emph{teaching dimension}
  of concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ in model $M$—defined to be the number of examples
  required for teaching a concept, in the worst case over all concepts in $\\mathcal{C}$.\r
  This paper introduces a new model of teaching, called no-clash teaching, together
  with the corresponding parameter $\\mathrm{NCTD}(\\mathcal{C})$. No-clash teaching
  is provably optimal in the strong sense that, given \\emph{any}\\/{concept} class
  $\\mathcal{C}$ and \\emph{any}\\/{model} $M$ obeying Goldman and Mathias’s collusion-freeness
  criterion, one obtains $\\mathrm{NCTD}(\\mathcal{C})\\le M$-$\\mathrm{TD}(\\mathcal{C})$.
  We also study a corresponding notion $\\mathrm{NCTD}^+$ for the case of learning
  from positive data only, establish useful bounds on $\\mathrm{NCTD}$ and $\\mathrm{NCTD}^+$,
  and discuss relations of these parameters to the VC-dimension and to sample compression.\r
  In addition to formulating an optimal model of collusion-free teaching, \r our main
  results are on the computational complexity of deciding whether $\\mathrm{NCTD}^+(\\mathcal{C})=k$
  (or $\\mathrm{NCTD}(\\mathcal{C})=k$) for given $\\mathcal{C}$ and $k$. We show
  some such decision problems to be equivalent to \r the existence question for certain
  constrained matchings in bipartite\r graphs. Our NP-hardness results for the latter
  are of independent interest in the study of constrained graph matchings."
