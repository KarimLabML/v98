title: A Sharp Lower Bound for Agnostic Learning with Sample Compression Schemes
abstract: "\r We establish a tight characterization of the worst-case rates for the
  excess risk of agnostic learning with sample compression schemes and for uniform
  convergence for agnostic sample compression schemes. In particular, we find that
  the optimal rates of convergence for size-$k$ agnostic sample compression schemes
  are of the form $\\sqrt{\\frac{k \\log(n/k)}{n}}$, which contrasts with agnostic
  learning with classes of VC dimension $k$, where the optimal rates are of the form
  $\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{n}}$.  \r "
