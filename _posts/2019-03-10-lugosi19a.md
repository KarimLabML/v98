title: Online Influence Maximization with Local Observations
abstract: "We consider an online influence maximization problem in which a\r decision
  maker selects a node among a large number of possibilities\r and places a piece
  of information at the node.\r The information then spreads in the network on a random
  set of edges. The goal of the decision maker is to reach\r as many nodes as possible,
  with the added complication that feedback is \r only available about the degree
  of the selected node. Our main result \r shows that such local observations can
  be sufficient for maximizing \r global influence in two broadly studied families
  of random graph models: \r stochastic block models and Chung–Lu models. With this
  insight, we propose\r a bandit algorithm that aims at maximizing local (and thus
  global) influence,\r and provide its theoretical analysis in both the subcritical
  \r and supercritical regimes of both considered models. Notably, our performance
  \r guarantees show no explicit dependence on the total number of nodes in the network,\r
  making our approach well-suited for large-scale applications."
