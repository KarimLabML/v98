title: 'Cleaning up the neighborhood: A full classification for adversarial partial
  monitoring'
abstract: "Partial monitoring is a generalization of the well-known multi-armed bandit
  framework where the loss is not directly observed by the learner. \r We complete
  the classification of finite adversarial partial monitoring to include all games,
  solving an open problem posed by Bartok et al. (2014). \r Along the way we simplify
  and improve existing algorithms and correct errors in previous analyses. Our second
  contribution is a new algorithm \r for the class of games studied by Bartok (2013)
  where we prove upper and lower regret bounds that shed more light on the dependence
  of the regret on the game structure."
