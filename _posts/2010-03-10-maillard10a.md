title: 'Sequential change-point detection: Laplace concentration of scan statistics
  and non-asymptotic delay bounds'
abstract: "\tWe consider  change-point detection in a fully sequential setup, when
  observations are received one by one and one must raise an alarm as early as possible
  after any change. We assume that both the change points and the distributions before
  and after the change are unknown.\tWe consider the class of  piecewise-constant
  mean processes with sub-Gaussian noise,  and we target a detection strategy that
  is uniformly good on this class (this constrains the false alarm rate and detection
  delay). We introduce a novel tuning of the GLR test that takes here a simple form
  involving scan statistics,\r based on a novel sharp concentration inequality using
  an extension of the Laplace method for scan-statistics \r that holds doubly-uniformly
  in time. This also considerably simplifies the implementation of the test and analysis.\r
  We provide (perhaps surprisingly) the first fully non-asymptotic analysis of the
  detection delay of this test that matches the known existing asymptotic orders,
  with fully explicit numerical constants.\r Then, we extend this analysis to allow
  some changes that are not-detectable by any uniformly-good strategy (the number
  of observations before and after the change are too small for it to be detected
  by any such algorithm), and provide the first robust, finite-time analysis of the
  detection delay."
