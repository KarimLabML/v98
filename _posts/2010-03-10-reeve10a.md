title: Exploiting geometric structure in mixture proportion estimation with generalised
  Blanchard-Lee-Scott estimators
abstract: "\r Mixture proportion estimation is a building block in many weakly supervised
  classification tasks (missing labels, label noise, anomaly detection).\r Estimators
  with finite sample guarantees help analyse algorithms for such tasks, but so far
  only exist for Euclidean and Hilbert space data.\r We generalise the framework of
  Blanchard, Lee and Scott to allow extensions to other data types, and exemplify
  its use by deducing novel estimators for metric space data, and for randomly compressed
  Euclidean data – both of which make use of favourable geometry to tighten guarantees.\r
  Finally we demonstrate a theoretical link with the state of the art estimator specialised
  for Hilbert space data."
