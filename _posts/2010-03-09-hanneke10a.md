title: Sample Compression for Real-Valued Learners
abstract: "\r We give an algorithmically efficient version of the\r learner-to-compression
  scheme conversion in Moran and Yehudayoff\r (2016). We further extend this technique
  to real-valued hypotheses,\r to obtain a bounded-size sample compression scheme
  via an efficient\r reduction to a certain generic real-valued learning strategy.
  To our\r knowledge, this is the first general compressed regression result\r (regardless
  of efficiency or boundedness) guaranteeing uniform\r approximate reconstruction.
  Along the way, we develop a generic\r procedure for constructing weak real-valued
  learners out of abstract\r regressors; this result is also of independent interest.
  In\r particular, this result sheds new light on an open question of\r H. Simon (1997).
  We show applications to two regression problems:\r learning Lipschitz and bounded-variation
  functions.\r "
