title: On Learning Graphs with Edge-Detecting Queries
abstract: "We consider the problem of learning a general graph $G=(V,E)$ using edge-detecting
  queries, where the number of vertices $|V|=n$ is given to the learner. The information
  theoretic lower bound gives $m\\log n$ for the number of queries, where $m=|E|$
  is the number of edges. In case the number of edges $m$ is also given to the
  learner, Angluin-Chenâ€™s Las Vegas algorithm runs in $4$ rounds and detects the edges
  in $O(m\\log n)$ queries. In the harder case where the number of edges $m$ is
  unknown, their algorithm runs in $5$ rounds and asks $O(m\\log n+\\sqrt{m}\\log^2
  n)$ queries. They presented two open problems: <em>(i)</em> can the number of queries
  be reduced to $O(m\\log n)$ in the second case, and, <em>(ii)</em> can the number
  of rounds be reduced without substantially increasing the number of queries (in
  both cases). 
  
  For the first open problem (when $m$ is unknown) we give two algorithms.
  The first is an $O(1)$-round Las Vegas algorithm that asks $m\\log n+\\sqrt{m}(\\log^{[k]}n)\\log
  n$ queries for any constant $k$ where $\\log^{[k]}n=\\log \\stackrel{k}{\\cdots}
  \\log n$. The second is an $O(\\log^*n)$-round Las Vegas algorithm that asks $O(m\\log
  n)$ queries. This solves the first open problem for any practical $n$, for example,
  $n<2^{65536}$. We also show that no deterministic algorithm can solve this problem
  in a constant number of rounds.
  
  To solve the second problem we study the case
  when $m$ is known. We first show that any non-adaptive Monte Carlo algorithm (one-round)
  must ask at least $\\Omega(m^2\\log n)$ queries, and any two-round Las Vegas algorithm
  must ask at least $m^{4/3-o(1)}\\log n$ queries on average. We then give two two-round
  Monte Carlo algorithms, the first asks $O(m^{4/3}\\log n)$ queries for any $n$ and
  $m$, and the second asks $O(m\\log n)$ queries when $n>2^m$. Finally, we give a
  $3$-round Monte Carlo algorithm that asks $O(m\\log n)$ queries for any $n$ and
  $m$."
