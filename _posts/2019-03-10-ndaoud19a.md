title: Interplay of minimax estimation and minimax support recovery under sparsity
abstract: "In this paper, we study a new notion of scaled minimaxity for sparse estimation
  in high-dimensional linear regression model. We present more optimistic lower bounds
  than the one given by the classical minimax theory and hence improve on existing
  results. We recover sharp results for the global minimaxity as a consequence of
  our study. Fixing the scale of the signal-to-noise ratio, we prove that the estimation
  error can be much smaller than the global minimax error. We construct a new optimal
  estimator for the scaled minimax sparse estimation. An optimal adaptive procedure
  is also described.\r "
