title: Online Non-Additive Path Learning under Full and Partial Information
abstract: "  We study the problem of online path learning with non-additive\r gains,
  which is a central problem appearing in several applications,\r including ensemble
  structured prediction. We present new online\r algorithms for path learning with
  non-additive count-based gains for\r the three settings of full information, semi-bandit
  and full\r bandit with very favorable regret guarantees. A key component of\r our
  algorithms is the definition and computation of an intermediate\r context-dependent
  automaton that enables us to use existing\r algorithms designed for additive gains.
  \ We further apply our\r methods to the important application of ensemble structured\r
  prediction.  Finally, beyond count-based gains, we give an efficient\r implementation
  of the EXP3 algorithm for the full bandit setting\r with an arbitrary (non-additive)
  gain."
