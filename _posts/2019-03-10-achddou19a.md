title: A minimax near-optimal algorithm for adaptive rejection sampling
abstract: Rejection Sampling is a fundamental Monte-Carlo method. It is used to sample
  from distributions admitting a probability density function which can be evaluated
  exactly at any given point, albeit at a high computational cost. However, without
  proper tuning, this technique implies a high rejection rate. Several methods have
  been explored to cope with this problem, based on the principle of adaptively estimating
  the density by a simpler function, using the information of the previous samples.
  Most of them either rely on strong assumptions on the form of the density, or do
  not offer any theoretical performance guarantee. We give the first theoretical lower
  bound for the problem of adaptive rejection sampling and introduce a new algorithm
  which guarantees a near-optimal rejection rate in a minimax sense.
