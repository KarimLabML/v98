title: Improved Generalization Bounds for Robust Learning
abstract: "We consider a model of robust learning in an adversarial\r environment.
  The learner gets uncorrupted training data with access\r to possible corruptions
  that may be effected by the adversary during\r testing. The learnerâ€™s goal is to
  build a robust classifier that would be\r tested on future adversarial examples.
  We use a zero-sum game\r between the learner and the adversary as our game theoretic\r
  framework. The adversary is limited to $k$ possible corruptions for\r each input.
  Our model is closely related to the adversarial examples\r model of Schmidt et al.
  (2018); Madry et al. (2017).\r Our main results consist of generalization bounds
  for the binary and\r multi-class classification, as well as the real-valued case
  (regression).\r For the binary classification setting, we both tighten the generalization
  bound of\r Feige, Mansour, and Schapire (2015), and also are able to handle an infinite
  hypothesis class $H$. \r The sample complexity is improved from\r $O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^4}\\log(\\frac{|H|}{\\delta}))$
  to $O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}(k\\log(k)VC(H)+\\log\\frac{1}{\\delta}))$.\r Additionally,
  we extend the algorithm and generalization bound from the binary\r to the multiclass
  and real-valued cases. Along the way, we obtain results on fat-shattering dimension
  \r and Rademacher complexity of $k$-fold maxima over function classes; these may
  be of independent interest.\r For binary classification, the algorithm of Feige
  et al. (2015) uses a regret minimization algorithm \r and an ERM oracle as a blackbox;
  we adapt it for the multi-class and regression settings. \r The algorithm provides
  us with near optimal policies for the players on a given training sample."
