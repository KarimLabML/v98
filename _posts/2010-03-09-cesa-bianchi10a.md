title: Dynamic Pricing with Finitely Many Unknown Valuations
abstract: "Motivated by posted price auctions where buyers are grouped in an unknown
  number of latent types characterized by their private values for the good on sale,
  we investigate regret minimization in stochastic dynamic pricing when the distribution
  of buyers’ private values is supported on an unknown set of points in $[0,1]$ of
  unknown cardinality $K$.\r "
