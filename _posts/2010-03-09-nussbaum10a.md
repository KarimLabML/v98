title: Ising Models with Latent Conditional Gaussian Variables
abstract: " Ising models describe the joint probability distribution of a vector of
  binary feature variables. Typically, not all the variables interact with each other
  and one is interested in learning the presumably sparse network structure of the
  interacting variables. However, in the presence of latent variables, the conventional
  method of learning a sparse model might fail. This is because the latent variables
  induce indirect interactions of the observed variables.  In the case of only a few
  latent conditional {Gaussian} variables these spurious interactions contribute an
  additional low-rank component to the interaction parameters of the observed Ising
  model.  Therefore, we propose to learn a sparse + low-rank decomposition of the
  parameters of an {Ising} model using a convex regularized likelihood problem.  We
  show that the same  problem can be obtained as the dual of a maximum-entropy problem
  with a new type of relaxation, where the sample means collectively need to match
  the expected values only up to a given tolerance. The solution to the convex optimization
  problem has consistency properties in the high-dimensional setting, where the number
  of observed binary variables and the number of latent conditional {Gaussian} variables
  are allowed to grow with the number of training samples."
