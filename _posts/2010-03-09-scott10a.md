title: A Generalized Neyman-Pearson Criterion for Optimal Domain Adaptation
abstract: In the problem of domain adaptation for binary classification, the learner
  is presented with labeled examples from a source domain, and must correctly classify
  unlabeled examples from a target domain, which may differ from the source. Previous
  work on this problem has assumed that the performance measure of interest is the
  expected value of some loss function. We study a Neyman-Pearson-like criterion and
  argue that, for this optimality criterion, stronger domain adaptation results are
  possible than what has previously been established. In particular, we study a class
  of domain adaptation problems that generalizes both the covariate shift assumption
  and a model for feature-dependent label noise, and establish optimal classification
  on the target domain despite not having access to labelled data from this domain.
