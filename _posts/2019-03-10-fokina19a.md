title: Limit Learning Equivalence Structures
abstract: "While most research in Gold-style learning focuses on learning formal languages,
  we consider the identification of computable structures, specifically equivalence
  structures. In our core model the learner gets more and more information about which
  pairs of elements of a structure are related and which are not. The aim of the learner
  is to find (an effective description of) the isomorphism type of the structure presented
  in the limit. In accordance with language learning we call this learning criterion
  $\mathbf{InfEx}$-learning (explanatory learning from informant).\r Our main contribution
  is a complete characterization of which families of equivalence structures are  $\mathbf{InfEx}$-learnable.
  This characterization allows us to derive a bound of $\mathbf{0”}$ on the computational
  complexity required to learn uniformly enumerable families  of equivalence structures.
  We also investigate variants of $\mathbf{InfEx}$-learning, including learning from text
  (where the only information provided is which elements are related, and not which
  elements are not related) and finite learning (where the first actual conjecture
  of the learner has to be correct).\r Finally, we show how learning families of
  structures relates to learning classes of languages by mapping learning tasks for
  structures to equivalent learning tasks for languages."
