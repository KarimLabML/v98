title: 'PeerReview4All: Fair and Accurate Reviewer Assignment in  Peer Review'
abstract: We consider the problem of automated assignment of papers to reviewers in
  conference peer review, with a focus on fairness and statistical accuracy. Our fairness
  objective is to maximize the review quality of the most disadvantaged paper, in
  contrast to the popular objective of maximizing the total  quality over all papers.
  We design an assignment algorithm based on an incremental max-flow procedure that
  we prove is near-optimally fair. Our statistical accuracy objective is to ensure
  correct recovery of the papers that should be accepted. With a sharp minimax analysis
  we also prove that our algorithm leads to assignments with strong statistical guarantees
  both in an objective-score model as well as a novel subjective-score model that
  we propose in this paper.
