title: Two-Player Games for Efficient Non-Convex Constrained Optimization
abstract: "In recent years, constrained optimization has become increasingly relevant
  to the machine learning community, with applications including Neyman-Pearson classification,
  robust optimization, and fair machine learning. A natural approach to constrained
  optimization is to optimize the Lagrangian, but this is not guaranteed to work in
  the non-convex setting, and, if using a first-order method, cannot cope with non-differentiable
  constraints (e.g. constraints on rates or proportions).\r The Lagrangian can be
  interpreted as a two-player game played between a player who seeks to optimize over
  the model parameters, and a player who wishes to maximize over the Lagrange multipliers.
  We propose a non-zero-sum variant of the Lagrangian formulation that can cope with
  non-differentiable—even discontinuous—constraints, which we call the “proxy-Lagrangian”.
  The first player minimizes external regret in terms of easy-to-optimize “proxy constraints”,
  while the second player enforces the \\emph{original} constraints by minimizing
  swap regret.\r For this new formulation, as for the Lagrangian in the non-convex
  setting, the result is a stochastic classifier. For both the proxy-Lagrangian and
  Lagrangian formulations, however, we prove that this classifier, instead of having
  unbounded size, can be taken to be a distribution over no more than $m+1$ models
  (where $m$ is the number of constraints). This is a significant improvement in practical
  terms."
