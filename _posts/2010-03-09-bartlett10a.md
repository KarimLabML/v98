title: A simple parameter-free and adaptive approach to optimization under a minimal
  local smoothness assumption
abstract: "We study the problem of optimizing a function under a \\emph{budgeted number
  of evaluations}. We only assume that the function is \\emph{locally} smooth around
  one of its global optima. The difficulty of optimization is measured in terms of
  1) the amount of \\emph{noise} $b$ of the function evaluation and 2)\tthe local
  smoothness, $d$, of the function. A smaller $d$ results in smaller optimization
  error. We come with a new, simple, and parameter-free approach. First, for all values
  of $b$ and $d$, this approach recovers at least the state-of-the-art regret guarantees.
  Second, our approach additionally obtains these results while being \\textit{agnostic}
  to the values of both $b$ and $d$. This leads to the first algorithm that naturally
  adapts to an \\textit{unknown} range of noise $b$ and leads to significant improvements
  in a moderate and low-noise regime. Third, our approach also obtains a remarkable
  improvement over the state-of-the-art SOO algorithm when the noise is very low which
  includes the case of optimization under deterministic feedback ($b=0$).\tThere,
  under our minimal local smoothness assumption, this improvement is of exponential
  magnitude and holds for a class of functions that covers the vast majority of functions
  that practitioners optimize ($d=0$). We  show that our algorithmic improvement is
  borne out in  experiments as we empirically show faster convergence on common benchmarks."
