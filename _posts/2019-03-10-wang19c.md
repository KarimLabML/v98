title: Noninteractive Locally Private Learning of Linear Models via Polynomial Approximations
abstract: "Minimizing a convex risk function is the main step in many basic learning
  algorithms. \r We study protocols for convex optimization which provably leak very
  little about the individual data points that constitute the loss function. Specifically,
  we consider differentially private algorithms that operate in the local model, where
  each data record is stored on a separate user device and randomization is performed
  locally by those devices. We give new protocols for \\emph{noninteractive} LDP convex
  optimization—i.e., protocols that require only a single randomized report from each
  user to an untrusted aggregator. \r We study our algorithms’ performance with respect
  to expected loss—either over the data set at hand (empirical risk) or a larger population
  from which our data set is assumed to be drawn. Our error bounds depend on the form
  of individuals’ contribution to the expected loss. For the case of \\emph{generalized
  linear losses} (such as hinge and logistic losses), we give an LDP algorithm whose
  sample complexity is only linear in the dimensionality $p$ and quasi-polynomial
  in other terms (the privacy parameters $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$, and the desired
  excess risk $\\alpha$). This is the first algorithm for nonsmooth losses with sub-exponential
  dependence on $p$.\r For the Euclidean median problem, where the loss is given by
  the Euclidean distance to a given data point, we give a protocol whose sample complexity
  grows quasi-polynomially in $p$. This is the first protocol with sub-exponential
  dependence on $p$ for a loss that is not a generalized linear loss . \r Our result
  for the hinge loss is based on a technique, dubbed polynomial of inner product approximation,
  which may be applicable to other problems. Our results for generalized linear losses
  and the Euclidean median are based on new reductions to the case of hinge loss. "
