title: A tight excess risk bound via a unified PAC-Bayesian–Rademacher–Shtarkov–MDL
  complexity
abstract: "We present a novel notion of complexity that interpolates between and generalizes
  some classic complexity notions in learning theory: for empirical risk minimization
  (ERM) with arbitrary bounded loss, it is upper bounded in terms of data-independent
  Rademacher complexity; for generalized Bayesian estimators, it is upper bounded
  by the data-dependent information (KL) complexity. For ERM, the new complexity reduces
  to normalized maximum likelihood complexity, i.e., a minimax log-loss individual
  sequence regret.  Our first main result bounds excess risk in terms of the new complexity.
  Our second main result links the new complexity to $L_2(P)$ entropy via Rademacher
  complexity, generalizing earlier results of Opper, Haussler, Lugosi, and Cesa-Bianchi
  who covered the log-loss case with $L_\\infty$ entropy. Together, these results
  recover optimal bounds for VC-type and large (polynomial entropy) classes, replacing
  local Rademacher complexities by a simpler analysis which almost completely separates
  the two aspects that determine the achievable rates: ‘easiness’ (Bernstein) conditions
  and model complexity.\r "
