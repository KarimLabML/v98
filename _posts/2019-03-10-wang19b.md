title: Online Linear Optimization with Sparsity Constraints
abstract: "\r We study the problem of online linear optimization with sparsity constraints
  in the semi-bandit setting. It can be seen as a marriage between two well-known
  problems: the online linear optimization problem and the combinatorial bandit problem.
  For this problem, we provide an algorithm which is efficient and achieves a sublinear
  regret bound. Moreover, we extend our results to two generalized settings, one with
  delayed feedbacks and one with costs for receiving feedbacks. Finally, we conduct
  experiments which show the effectiveness of our methods in practice."
